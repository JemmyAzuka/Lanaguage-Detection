# Language-Detection



This repository provides a simple and straightforward example of language detection using popular Python libraries. Language detection plays a crucial role in text processing and analysis, and this project demonstrates how to use the provided libraries to achieve accurate language classification.



## Libraries Used

pandas (imported as pd): Used for data manipulation and handling datasets efficiently.

NumPy (imported as np): Utilized for numerical computations and array operations.

Sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer: Used to convert text data into numerical feature vectors suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split: Used to split the dataset into training and testing subsets for model evaluation.

Sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB: Implemented for building a Naive Bayes classifier, a common choice for text classification tasks.



## Usage

The main part of the project is demonstrated in the language_detector.ipynb notebook. It covers the entire process, from loading and preprocessing the dataset to training the language detection model and making predictions.

Follow the code and explanations in the notebook to understand each step of the process. Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different parameters, techniques, or datasets.



## Dataset

For this demonstration, a sample dataset is provided (language_dataset.csv). The dataset contains text samples from various languages. You can use this dataset to follow along with the notebook and practice language detection.



## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the need for practical examples of language detection using Python libraries. It aims to provide a clear starting point for anyone interested in implementing language detection in their projects.




Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt this project for your own language detection tasks. If you find it helpful, don't forget to start the repository!
